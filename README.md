# Mimosa: Advancing microRNA Target Site Prediction with Transformer and Base-Pairing Patterns

This repository contains code and data for Mimosa, a tool designed to recognize miRNA targets, including both canonical and elusive non-canonical sites. It uses the Transformer framework and integrates base-pairing patterns to capture in-depth attributes. Mimosa has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing deep learning models and can be applied across diverse species. As an independent tool, Mimosa requires no third-party software and holds promise for facilitating miRNA-specific target identification and exploring intricate small RNA regulatory network.
