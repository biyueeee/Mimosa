# Mimosa: Advancing microRNA Target Site Prediction with Transformer and Base-Pairing Patterns
## Background
Comprehensive identification of miRNA targets is crucial for deepening our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the precise regulation of gene expression.Here, We introduce Mimosa, a deep learning-based approach for miRNA target identification, adept at recognizing the elusive ‘non-canonical sites’ in human species. Mimosa employs the Transformer framework and integrates base-pairing patterns to capture in-depth attributes.
